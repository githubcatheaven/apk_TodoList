# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing an Android todo list application with the package name `com.canme.todo`. The application will provide users with a simple and intuitive way to manage their daily tasks, allowing them to create, organize, and track their todo items on their Android devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create new todo items, so that I can keep track of tasks I need to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the "Add Todo" button THEN the system SHALL display a text input field for entering the todo item
2. WHEN the user enters text and confirms THEN the system SHALL save the todo item to local storage
3. WHEN the user enters an empty todo item THEN the system SHALL display an error message and not save the item
4. WHEN a todo item is successfully created THEN the system SHALL display it in the main todo list

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all my todo items in a list, so that I can see what tasks I have pending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display all saved todo items in a scrollable list
2. WHEN there are no todo items THEN the system SHALL display an empty state message
3. WHEN todo items are displayed THEN the system SHALL show the task text and completion status for each item
4. WHEN the list is long THEN the system SHALL allow smooth scrolling through all items

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to mark todo items as completed, so that I can track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps on a todo item checkbox THEN the system SHALL toggle the completion status
2. WHEN a todo item is marked as completed THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the completed state (strikethrough text)
3. WHEN a completed item is tapped again THEN the system SHALL mark it as incomplete
4. WHEN the completion status changes THEN the system SHALL persist the change to local storage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete todo items, so that I can remove tasks that are no longer relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user long-presses on a todo item THEN the system SHALL display a delete confirmation dialog
2. WHEN the user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the item from storage and the display
3. WHEN the user cancels deletion THEN the system SHALL keep the item unchanged
4. WHEN an item is deleted THEN the system SHALL update the list view immediately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my todo items to persist between app sessions, so that I don't lose my tasks when I close the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user closes and reopens the app THEN the system SHALL display all previously saved todo items
2. WHEN the device is restarted THEN the system SHALL retain all todo items
3. WHEN the app crashes or is force-closed THEN the system SHALL preserve all saved todo items
4. WHEN data is saved THEN the system SHALL use local device storage (SQLite or SharedPreferences)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to have a clean and intuitive interface, so that I can easily manage my todos without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display a Material Design compliant interface
2. WHEN the user interacts with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback
3. WHEN the app is used on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
4. WHEN the user navigates the app THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent UI patterns throughout

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reorder my todo items by dragging them up or down, so that I can prioritize my tasks according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user long-presses and drags a todo item THEN the system SHALL allow moving the item to a different position
2. WHEN the user drops the item in a new position THEN the system SHALL update the order and persist it to storage
3. WHEN items are reordered THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback during the drag operation
4. WHEN the reorder is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the new order across app sessions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to categorize my todos with different types/categories, so that I can organize my tasks by context or priority.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates a new todo THEN the system SHALL allow selecting a category from predefined options
2. WHEN todos are displayed THEN the system SHALL show the category with visual indicators (colors/icons)
3. WHEN the user views the todo list THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by category
4. WHEN categories are used THEN the system SHALL support at least: Personal, Work, Shopping, Health, and Other

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use swipe gestures to quickly complete or delete todos, so that I can efficiently manage my tasks with intuitive touch interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user swipes right on a todo item THEN the system SHALL mark it as completed
2. WHEN the user swipes left on a todo item THEN the system SHALL delete the item after confirmation
3. WHEN swiping occurs THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing the intended action
4. WHEN a swipe action is completed THEN the system SHALL animate the change and update the storage

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reliably toggle todo completion status by clicking the checkbox, so that I can quickly mark tasks as done or undone without any interaction issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a todo item checkbox THEN the system SHALL immediately toggle the completion status
2. WHEN the checkbox is clicked THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback (checked/unchecked state)
3. WHEN the completion status changes THEN the system SHALL persist the change to storage immediately
4. WHEN other interactions occur (category changes, text edits, drag operations) THEN the checkbox functionality SHALL remain unaffected

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a user, I want to change todo categories by clicking the category icon, so that I can reorganize my tasks without the category being affected by other operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a todo item's category icon THEN the system SHALL display a category selection dialog
2. WHEN the user selects a new category THEN the system SHALL update the todo's category immediately
3. WHEN the user toggles completion status THEN the category SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN the user edits the todo text THEN the category SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN the user drags to reorder todos THEN the category SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit todo text by clicking on it, so that I can modify task descriptions using the same interface as when creating new todos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a todo item's text THEN the system SHALL display an edit dialog with the current text
2. WHEN the edit dialog opens THEN the system SHALL use the same UI component as the "Add Todo" dialog
3. WHEN the user saves changes THEN the system SHALL update the todo text and close the dialog
4. WHEN the user cancels editing THEN the system SHALL discard changes and close the dialog
5. WHEN text editing occurs THEN other todo properties (category, completion status) SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 13

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth magnetic drag-and-drop reordering with enhanced visual feedback, so that I can intuitively reorganize my todos with a polished user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user drags a todo item past 50% of another item's height THEN the system SHALL trigger a magnetic snap effect
2. WHEN the magnetic snap occurs THEN the system SHALL animate the reordering with spring-based physics
3. WHEN dragging occurs THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced visual feedback (increased elevation, scale, and transparency)
4. WHEN the drag operation completes THEN the system SHALL smoothly animate items back to their normal appearance
5. WHEN reordering happens THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth 60fps animations throughout the interaction
